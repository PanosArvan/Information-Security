#The Phreaky World of PBX Hacking

-Phone hacking costs companies billions of dollars each year and it keeps increasing.

-One of those ways is to call a company's phone with the expectation of getting to the voice mail and then redirect the forwarding number to their pay-per-min line.

-In that way they can start charging the companies everytime they call it. This works on line phones.

-Some companies use something called a phone branch exchange or PBX. This system gives guidance to the phones how to operate. The system though is online.

-Many of the PBX systems remain unsecured or given to the security contractor that is the least expensive, usually getting subpar quality.

-For a hacker, a PBX system that hasn't been properly set-up is an easy target to penetrate. 

-If they find the IP address of the PBX they can make calls that originate from that office, hence racking up big sums of money to that company's phone bill.

-The FBI will not help unless they have enough data. But reporting is something that most companies want to avoid due to bad publicity.

-Nonetheless, at some point FBI did gather enough data to notice patterns. Their efforts led to two names: Farhan Arshad and Noor Aziz Uddin.

-Those two were put in the Cyber's Most Wanted List with a 50.000$ bounty for any information leading to them.

-Those people fled back to Pakistan where the FIA, the Federal Investigation Agency of Pakistan, got a tip eventually from someone that knew the cellphone number of Uddin.

-Then by tracking the GPS of that phone, they eventually raided his house, where they found both of them. Now they are in jail.

-In total it is claimed they costed 50 million dollars in damages. Before their arrest the two were investing in land and businesses.
