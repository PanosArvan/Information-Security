### 1.1 Terminology

A cryptosystem is comprised of the cryptographic algorithm, the ciphertexts, the keys and all the possible plaintexts.
There are two types of algorithms.

Symmetric and Assymetric.

On the symmetric one the encryption and decryption key are the same. Hence the key must remain secret and somehow transferred between the ones that need it. 
On the asymmetric one the keys are different. The encryption key is public and the decryption one is private.

### 1.2 Steganography



### 1.3 Substitution Ciphers and Transposition Ciphers



### 1.4 Simple XOR



### 1.5 One-Time Pads



### 1.6 Computer Algorithms

Most common cryptographic algorithms:

1. DES (Data Encryption Standard): It's a symmetric algorithm, which means that the same key is used for encryption and decryption.
2. RSA: Assymetric algorithm, can also be used for digital signatures.
3. DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm): Only used for digital signatures.

### 1.7 Large Numbers

Here the author refers to significantly large numbers that he uses to navigate around examples in the rest of the book.
