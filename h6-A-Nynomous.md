## [Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/7-things-you-should-know-about-tor)

Summary:

1. **Tor Still Works**: Despite attempts by organizations like the NSA to compromise it, Tor remains effective at providing anonymity. Most attacks on Tor involve exploiting browser bugs or user misconfigurations, rather than breaking its cryptographic security.
2. **Tor is Not Only Used by Criminals**: Tor is used not only by criminals and corrupted groups of people, but also activists, military personnel, journalists and private people seeking privacy. There are more sophisticated tools that criminals can use like botnets with malware or identity theft.
3. **Tor Does Not Have a Military Backdoor**: While it was initialy a US Navy project, since it's open source it has been verified by multiple trust-worthy sources that there is no backdoor for the military.
4. **No One in the US Has Been Prosecuted For Running a Tor Relay**: There have been no prosecutions in US since Tor relay is not illegal under US law.
5. **Tor is Easy to Use**: There are easy ways to to access Tor such as the Tor Browser Bundle, which is preconfigured for safety, or Tails, a live operating system that routes internet connections through Tor.
6. **Tor is Not as Slow as You Think**: Tor might be slower than regular internet connections but efforts are made by engineers to improve its speed. Creating more relays is another way.
7. **Tor is Not Foolproof**: If Tor is used incorrectly it can infact compromise your anonymity. That is why Tor Browser Bundle or Tails should be used, software should be kept updated and services like Google or Facebook should be avoided as they can still see communications within their systems.

## Install Tor / Access Tor

First I go to this website to download it:

[Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/download/)

![tor1](https://github.com/PanosArvan/Information-Security/assets/145275148/dff12493-51e1-46f1-bce4-72e848cf80d8)

Then I search in DuckDuckGo while onionized for dark web marketplaces:

![tor4](https://github.com/PanosArvan/Information-Security/assets/145275148/2cdd6af3-a42a-4d19-8d40-68bccc096ef2)

These two websites provide info on a few marketplaces. 99% of them regarding something illegal"

[Marketplace1](https://darkwebmarket.net/)

[Marketplace2](https://cypher-marketplace.com/)

Using the cypher-marketplace I was able to find Cocorico Market, where they sell illegal drugs (NOTE! This is done solely for observational and research reasons within the realm of academic assignments, NO purpose in participating in any kind of illegal activity.):
