## Video Killed the Text Star: OSINT Approach by Fran Gomez and Cesar Jimenez

### Talks about open-source intelligence (OSINT) and Face Recognition.

*OSINT is the data collected from publicly available sources to be used in an intelligence context.*

Can be used in the context of:

- National Security
- Counterterrorism
- Cyber Tracking of persona non-grata
- Search missing people
- Identify people related to sexual violence crimes
- Identity theft
- Monitor competitors activities
- Gather information about a specific target (hacking)
- Marketing ROI (Sports, Youtube,...)

*Face recognition through video is one of the most advanced fields within machine learning in the past few years.*

1. HOG: Histogram of Oriented Gradients developed by Navneet Dalal and Bill Triggs in 2005.

Tries to detect when the dark spots in an image move and through gradients try to find patters.

Has difficulty when the person is not looking in the same direction as the original tracking image.

2. CNN: Convolutional Neural Network
