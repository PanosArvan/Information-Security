## Threat modeling

The Threat Modeling Manifesto, available at https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/, 
outlines a set of principles and guidelines for effective threat modeling in cybersecurity.

These are:

- Collaboration: Emphasizes the importance of collaborative efforts in threat modeling within the cybersecurity domain.
- Simplicity: Stresses the need for simplicity in the threat modeling process, advocating for straightforward and easily understandable practices.
- Adaptability: Encourages an adaptable approach, recognizing that threat modeling should seamlessly integrate into development workflows.
- Integration: Highlights the necessity of integrating threat modeling into development processes, making it an inherent part of the software development life cycle.
- Prioritization: Recommends prioritizing relevant threats, focusing on those that pose the most significant risks to the security of the system.
- Diversity of Perspectives: Acknowledges the importance of incorporating diverse perspectives into the threat modeling process to enhance the identification and mitigation of potential threats.
- Resource for Professionals: Positions itself as a valuable resource for cybersecurity professionals looking to refine their threat modeling approach and bolster the security resilience of software systems.

Threat model is used to anticipate problems when it's inexpensive to deal with them.

Four question framework for threat modeling:

-What are we working on?
-What can go wrong?
-What are we going to do about it?
-Did we do a good enough job?

The OWASP Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet offers a comprehensive guide for effective threat modeling in cybersecurity.

It covers essential concepts, methodologies, and best practices for identifying, assessing, and mitigating security threats in software systems.

The cheat sheet serves as a practical resource, providing step-by-step guidance for security professionals involved in threat modeling processes.

It offers detailed, step-by-step guidance to enhance the robustness of threat modeling processes.

The cheat sheet includes considerations and factors to be taken into account during the threat modeling process, contributing to a thorough and effective approach.

Tailored for security professionals, it is designed to aid them in strengthening the security posture of software systems.
